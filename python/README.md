# Programming with Python

## Lesson Overview

This lesson is intended to provide a brief introduction to writing programs in Python. After a short time covering the basics of variables, data structures, and flow control, the material focusses on how best to use the language to get things done. This means an emphasis on functions and module libraries, especially Pandas for data analysis. We also hope to be able to spend some time covering scripting and good practice in code organisation/documentation/user interface. 

This lesson material is based on a combination of the Software Carpentry [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) and [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) lessons and the instructors' own material.
